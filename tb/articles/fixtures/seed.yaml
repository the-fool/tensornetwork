    title: "Quantum Lorem Ipsum"
    summary: "Strongly correlated quantum systems give rise to many exotic physical phenomena, including
              high-temperature superconductivity. Simulating these systems on quantum computers may avoid the
              prohibitively high computational cost incurred in classical approaches. However, systematic errors and
              decoherence effects presented in current quantum devices make it difficult to achieve this. Here, we
              simulate the dynamics of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using 16 qubits on a digital
              superconducting quantum processor. We observe separations in the spreading velocities of charge and spin
              densities in the highly excited regime, a regime that is beyond the conventional quasiparticle picture. To
              minimize systematic errors, we introduce an accurate gate calibration procedure that is fast enough to
              capture temporal drifts of the gate parameters. We also employ a sequence of error-mitigation techniques
              to reduce decoherence effects and residual systematic errors."
